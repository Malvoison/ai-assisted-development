# AI-Assisted Development Maturity Model

## Level 1 – Code Monkey
Basic prompt-to-code usage. Minimal context or review. Output treated as boilerplate.

## Level 2 – Smart Pair Programmer
Adds problem framing, constraints, and examples. Iterates with AI like a junior dev. Tactical focus.

## Level 3 – Collaborative Designer
Uses AI for design, review, and implementation planning. Creates persistent design artifacts. Integrates guardrails and context.

## Level 4 – Orchestrator
Composes AI agents as services. Builds prompt libraries and integrates AI into CI/CD. Adds governance and traceability.

## Level 5 – Team Force Multiplier
Workflow becomes team standard. AI handles boilerplate; humans focus on architecture. Tracks metrics and links designs to tickets.

## Level 6 – Org-Level Co-Pilot
AI is embedded in SDLC. Central registry for prompts and designs. Compliance, provenance, and risk logging standardized.

## Level 7 – Autonomous R&D Cell
Semi-autonomous AI pods explore greenfield problems. AI evaluates tradeoffs and produces living documentation. Humans curate and integrate.
